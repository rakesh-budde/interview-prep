> When you practice, do not use an IDE. You need to be able to write
> legible, compilable code without help with regards to layout, or
> spelling of standard library class/method names. We suggest solving
> similar style algorithmic/ DS problems on a google document or on
> paper to simulate a real interview. Several sites that provide similar

> **Interview behaviors to note**
>
> ○ Talk through your thought process about the questions you are asked.
> In all of Mercari's interviews, our engineers are evaluating not only
> your technical abilities but also how you approach problems and how
> you try to solve them.
>
> ○ Ask clarifying questions if you do not understand the problem or
> need more information. Many of the questions asked in Mercari
> interviews are deliberately underspecified because our engineers are
> looking to see how you engage the problem. In particular, they are
> looking to see which areas leap to your mind as the most important
> piece of the technological puzzle you\'ve presented.
>
> ○ Think about ways to improve the solution you\'ll present. In many
> cases, the first answer that springs to mind isn\'t the most elegant
> solution and may need some refining. It\'s definitely worthwhile to
> talk about your initial thoughts to a question, but jumping
> immediately into presenting a brute force solution will be received
> less well than taking time to compose a more efficient solution.
>
> ○ Access to a computer at the time of interview is required as you
> will be requested to write and share code. Interviewers may use Google
> Docs to facilitate coding in real time
